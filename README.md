# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-Neural-Networks
This project demonstrates how to use neural networks for binary classification problems like breast cancer diagnosis. The model successfully predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The neural network model achieves high accuracy, and the performance is tracked and visualized using various plots.
